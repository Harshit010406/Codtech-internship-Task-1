# Codtech-internship
During the internship, I developed an ETL data pipeline using Pandas and Scikit-learn, built deep learning models with TensorFlow/PyTorch, completed an end-to-end data science project with deployment via Flask/FastAPI, and solved business problems using optimization techniques with PuLP in Python.
